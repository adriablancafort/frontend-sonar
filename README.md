# 🎧 MySonar – Frontend Repository

Welcome to the **frontend codebase** of **MySonar**, a mobile application designed to help users of the Sónar Festival make stress-free decisions about which concerts and activities to attend.

At Sónar, multiple stages and events happen simultaneously, often featuring lesser-known or highly experimental artists. This can lead to uncertainty or decision fatigue among festival-goers. **MySonar aims to reduce that anxiety** by offering a tailored, user-friendly experience to guide people through the festival in a more informed and relaxed way.
